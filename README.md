```
// create
self.player = [[LLVideoPlayer alloc] init];
[self.view addSubview:self.player.view];
self.player.view.frame = CGRectMake(10, 80, 300, 200);
self.player.delegate = self;


// load
NSURL *url = [NSURL URLWithString:@"<your stream url>"];  
[self.player loadVideoWithStreamURL:url];


// pause
